Make sure you are calendaring well, and reviewing that often to ensure you are making the best use of your time.
I will set aside specific time to practice terminal and Git commands.
I will set aside specific time to review previous sessions notes and watch the recordings.
Graham has been extremely helpful and supportive, ready to answer any questions i've had and guide me if he doesn't know the answer. He is invaluable to me.
Git takes practice!
